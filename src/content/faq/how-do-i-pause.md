title: How do I pause?
---

You may not have enough work to fill up the entire month or the billing period of the partnership plan. You may only have a few requests at the moment. In this case, you can pause your subscription.

Billing cycles are based on a 31-day period. For example, you subscribed to the Apprentice plan for 15 days. You can pause your subscription and come back later when you have more work. The next time you come back, you will be able to resume your subscription and use up any remaining days you have left.

When you pause your subscription, you will receive up to 3 months of free support and maintenance. This does not include adding new features or filling in requests.

### If you want to *pause* your subscription, please send us an email to info@modiggo.com
