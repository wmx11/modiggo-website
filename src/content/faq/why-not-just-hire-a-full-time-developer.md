title: Why wouldn't I just hire a full-time developer?
---

High-quality, senior-level, full-time developers come with a lot of overhead. You would have to pay at least **$135,000 per year, plus benefits**. When you run out of work to keep your full-time developers busy, you will be stuck paying them a high salary. Also, good luck finding one!

Our partnership plans allow you to plan out your budget in advance. And pause or cancel whenever you have no additional work coming in.

Additionally, whenever you let go of a full-time developer, you are exposed to a lack of support and maintenance. **We will keep in touch with you for up to 3 months after partnership termination. For free**.
