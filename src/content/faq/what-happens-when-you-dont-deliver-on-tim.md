title: What if you don't deliver results on time?

In case of a delay, you will not have to pay extra. 

Every partnership plan has a set amount of work hours. If we exceed it due to issues on our side - we will pause your subscription until we deliver the results. You will be able to decide if you want to resume it afterwards.
