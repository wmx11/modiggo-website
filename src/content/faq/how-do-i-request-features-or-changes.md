title: How do I request features or changes?
---

When you subscribe to our partnership plan you will be assigned a Trello board.

You can create new requests under the **"Requests"** tab by clicking on the **"Add a card"** button.

When creating a new request, make sure you are as clear as possible. Provide a clear name and a clear description of what you expect, and what needs to be done.

If you have any images, content, or anything that would help us in the process, please include them with the request.

We will get back to you shortly to confirm that we have received your request or to refine them.
