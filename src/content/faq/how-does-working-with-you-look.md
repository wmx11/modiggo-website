title: How does working with you look?
---

Working with us is pretty simple.

If you have any questions or are not really sure about what would be the best partnership plan for you, schedule a call with us. We will be more than happy to discuss this! Of course, discovery calls are free.

If you are certain you will need a specific number of hours, subscribe to the plan that suits your needs and requirements.

Once you subscribe to a plan, we will create a Trello board where we will manage the work and where you will be able to submit requests, bug fixes, and content.

If you are a new customer, we would be more than happy to hop on a call with you and find out what you are looking for and what your expectations are.

Still have some questions? Feel free to email us at info@modiggo.com.
