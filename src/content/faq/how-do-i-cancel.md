title: How do I cancel?
---

You may not have enough work for the whole month or the duration of your subscription. Maybe your situation has changed and you no longer require our services.

In this case, you can choose to cancel your subscription.

When you cancel your subscription, you terminate your partnership agreement. You will receive up to 3 months of free support and maintenance from us to help you migrate to a new provider or answer your questions.

**Canceling your subscription will not refund any remainder you may have left.**

### If you want to *cancel* your subscription, please send us an email to info@modiggo.com
