**Having no website is detrimental** to your business. And no, simple Facebook, Instagram, or other social-media pages won't make the cut.  
<br/>

**75% of customers** will judge your credibility based on your website. Having a professional-looking website will lead to building more trust for your brand and increase conversion rates, and sales. By not having a website **you're essentially losing on 75% of your potential clients**.  
<br/>

Customers hate waiting. Something as insignificant as **a 1-second increase in page load times will smash your conversion rates down by 7%**! We put a lot of effort into making sure your website is as fast as possible.  
<br/>

But here's the caveat. Hiring someone to build you **a website will cost you anywhere from $3,000 to $15,000**!  
<br/>

As your digital blacksmith we look at you as our apprentice - someone who we can help and elevate to new heights. **It will cost you NOTHING**. But you will have to spend some time with us so we can forge your red-hot ideas into a great, professional website.
